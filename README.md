# BCS-Hacks-2022

This weekend, I got a chance to attend my first ever in-person hackathon BCS Hacks 2022, organized by the BCS club at the University of British Columbia and it was one of the best experiences I have ever had!

Along with my teammates Adwait Kulkarni, Yining Song, Yuxuan Wang, we built a website using the Google Maps API that tracks the nearest pharmacies around you while facilitating an anonymous interaction between you and the pharmacist thereby enabling you to buy stuff without being embarrassed by what you are buying.

Needless to say, it was extremely fun to lay down the blueprint of the website as well as for deciding the best approach to improve user interaction, all within 10 hours!

Looking forward to participating in similar in-person events in the future!
